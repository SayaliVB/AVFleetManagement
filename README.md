# AVFleetManagement

AV Fleet Management Cloud for Road Services - Project Requirements:

Your cloud platform must support the following users:

- AV service cloud staff – This user group provides online cloud services for system administration and management, and real-time AV fleet tracking, and statistics.

- AV drivers – This AV user group could this service cloud platform to access their AV status (suchas power status, sensor issues), get the necessary road services from AAA, and AV maintenance services.

If your team select this project option, you team must select and complete the following components based on selected components from the previous project.

- Component #1 – A cloud -based AV fleet management system dashboard which provides a map- based graphic user interface to support the system and user interactions relating to AV fleet management services. Special alerts will be displayed to AV users, and cloud staff.
  
- Component #2 – AV and driver registration management which register each AV and its driver to the cloud system online.

- Component #3 – AV fleet management component which adds, deletes, and updates, and view diverse AVs in the cloud DB.
  
- Component #4 – Real-time AV tracking and monitor which supports real-time tracking and monitor of AVs on-roads for diverse status, including location, power, problematic sensor information, and moving statues.

Integrated with Carla (AV simulator) URL: http://carla.org//


Integration requirements: 
You need to integrate with Carla simulator for your AV cars. 


Design and implementation requirements: 
Since we have provided some system design, we expect the group should follow the basic design features and demonstrate a similar (or better) user interface. 

Deployment requirements: 
Your project outcome must be deployed on Amazon EC2 to demonstrate your project.
